This is a program that incorporates the use of a pure virtual function, an abstract class to implement polymorphism, and inheritance.  I created an abstract class called Monster in which many other classes were derived from. The classes derived from Monster were: Goblin, Troll, Dragon.  From Dragon two other classes IceDragon, and Fire Dragon were derived.  Each monster can attack, and each monster has unique abilities in their attack. 
The biggest issue that I encountered involved using the attack function for each monster's special ability.  It was a bit challenging to figure out the percentage of each monster has of having their attack.  That resulted in some errors during compilation.  Once they were fixed, the program compiled with no issues.  The program also uses a makefile with the command all to compile.
